## My notes from MIT 6.S191 introduction to Deep Learning Course.
### They are wonderfully illustrated with diagrams and code which can be even understood by people just starting out Deep Learning. 
### Taking a person from Zero to Hero. 
### The actual notes are in the [introtodeeplearning-MIT-6.S191.pdf](introtodeeplearning-MIT-6.S191.pdf) file.
#### They cover the following topics :
  1. Introduction to Deep Learning
  2. Recurrent Neural Network
  3. Convolutional Neural Network
  4. Deep Generative Modelling
  5. Reinforcement Learning
  6. Deep Learning new froniers
#### There were 3 labs in the course and the solution python notebooks can be found in :
  1. [Lab1](Lab1) covering the introduction and RNNs
  2. [Lab2](Lab2) covering CNNs and Deep Generative Modelling
  3. [Lab3](Lab3) covering RL
